Automation Scripts for Developers and Makers
======

This repo shows which automatisms are easily possible with Twitter, 
Makerlog and other services. Automate your life.

Structure
------

- The folders are subdivided according to social network / services.
- Most automatisms require PHP + Composer (Dependency Manager for PHP).
- The composer.json file contains all dependencies of all scripts.
- Each automatism is subdivided into its own folder, so everything remains clear.
- Each folder contains its own composer.json. This indicates which dependency the script needs.

### How-To Folder

The How To Folder owns explanations which explain the basic things.

Most developers should take these things for granted. 
However, if you don't know how to register a Twitter app or use Composer, 
I've written some short instructions to help you out here.

### Automatism folders

The following folders contain scripts that make your maker's life a little bit easier

- twitter

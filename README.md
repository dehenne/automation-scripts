Automation Scripts for Developers and Makers
======

This repo shows which automatisms are easily possible with Twitter, 
Makerlog and other services. Automate your life.

Structure
------

- The folders are subdivided according to social network / services.
- Most automatisms require PHP + Composer (Dependency Manager for PHP).
- The composer.json file contains all dependencies of all scripts.
- Each automatism is subdivided into its own folder, so everything remains clear.
- Each folder contains its own composer.json. This indicates which dependency the script needs.

Makerlog and other services. Automate your life.


How do i use this repo
------

This repository serves as a suggestion and help to automate your stuff. 
It should show you what can be done quickly and easily. 
The included scripts serve as your first starting point. 

This repository should not be a finished product or program that works out of the box. 
The scripts work out of the box but often you need a custom thing for yourself.

Consider the scripts rather as a small collection for you, 
which you can customize for your needs.


Structure
------

- The folders are subdivided according to social network / services.
- Most automatisms require PHP + Composer (Dependency Manager for PHP).
- The main [composer.json](composer.json) file contains all dependencies of all scripts.
- Each automatism is subdivided into its own folder, so everything remains clear.
- Each folder contains its own composer.json. This indicates which dependency the script needs.


### How-To Folder

The `how-to` Folder owns explanations which explain the basic things.

Most developers should take these things for granted. 
However, if you don't know how to register a Twitter app or use Composer, 
I've written some short instructions to help you out here.


### Automatism folders

The following folders contain scripts that make your maker's life a little bit easier

- makerlog
- steem
- twitter
